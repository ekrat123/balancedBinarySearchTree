# Binary Search Tree (BST) Implementation in JavaScript

This project implements a Binary Search Tree (BST) in JavaScript, providing a set of functionalities such as insertion, deletion, searching, tree traversal, balancing, and more.

## Introduction

A Binary Search Tree is a fundamental data structure that enables efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations. This project offers a JavaScript implementation of a BST through the `Tree` class and its associated methods.

## Features

- **BST Operations:** Insertion, Deletion, Searching
- **Tree Traversal:** In-order, Pre-order, Post-order, Level-order
- **Tree Balancing:** Automatic tree balancing using the `reBalance` method
- **Height and Depth:** Methods to calculate the height and depth of nodes
- **Balanced Check:** Check if the tree is balanced
